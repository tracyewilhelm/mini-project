        <p> Dolphins are amazing</p>
        <p> Dolphins are very smart marine mammals. They live in the water, but the breathe through a blow hole on top of their head. They are able to navigate, communicate, and find food using a type of sonar called echolocation. They mostly eat fish and squid. Dolphins have two stomachs. One is for storing food and the other is for digesting their food. 
            Dolphins live in large families called pods. They take care of each other, and even give each other names. Dolphins heal very quickly, and can even survive shark bites!
